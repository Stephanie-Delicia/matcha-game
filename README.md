# matcha-game
Personal project. I like matcha. So I want to make a game on making matcha.

Currently working on the visuals. Quick mock up below.

Priorities:
- The assets or visuals. Assets for drinks, then for other customer chars, then for styling the game up more, like chairs, tables, plants, etc. Oh, and of course the cafe itself. Outside and inside which might take a while. I want the player to be able to walk throughout the street, so further down the line, I would also like to design other houses. It's a lot, so I'll make sort of a schedule:
- Feb 7th: Have one customer done.
- Feb 11th: Have one drink (downscaled) done.
- Feb 12th: Having tables and chairs done.
- Feb 13th: Have exterior of cafe done.
- Feb 17th: Have interior of cafe done. (Only the register, windows, floor, tables and chairs.)
- Feb 20th: Have more of the interior done. (Menu?, plant decor)
- Feb 23rd: Street light?
- Feb 24th: Figure out how to have char move in environment.
- Feb 25th: Work on game plot. Game objectives.


# Update: March 3rd

Ok, I did not follow this timeline at all and just made a bunch of characters instead. I did brainstorm a bit of gameplay, but more of an overarching view, not of the specifics.

IT IS TIME TO BE STRICTER.
- Mar 5th: Have one drink (downscaled and upscaled) done.
- Mar 7th: Have exterior of cafe done. (Cafe, Sky, and either plants or street light)
- Mar 9th: Have table and chair done.
- Mar 11th: Have animations for Feyisola walking, Winnie sitting, and everybody else walking done.
- Mar 13th: Pick a language (I am between Java and C++) to have this in. I think most likely Java for me, but yeah. Then try to demo a char walking around.
- Mar 15th: Winnie running animation? I think Winnie will be the only one to be able to run.
- Mar 17th: Design interior of cafe.
- Mar 19th: Figure out how you want the close-up section of the game to be (when you are making the drink). Will it be show on a table? What are the specifics there?
