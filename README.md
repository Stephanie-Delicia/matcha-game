# matcha-game
Personal project. I like matcha. So I want to make a game on making matcha.

Currently working on the visuals. Quick mock up below.

Priorities:
- The assets or visuals. Assets for drinks, then for other customer chars, then for styling the game up more, like chairs, tables, plants, etc. Oh, and of course the cafe itself. Outside and inside which might take a while. I want the player to be able to walk throughout the street, so further down the line, I would also like to design other houses. It's a lot, so I'll make sort of a schedule:
- Feb 7th: Have one customer done.
- Feb 11th: Have one drink (downscaled) done.
- Feb 12th: Having tables and chairs done.
- Feb 13th: Have exterior of cafe done.
- Feb 17th: Have interior of cafe done. (Only the register, windows, floor, tables and chairs.)
- Feb 20th: Have more of the interior done. (Menu?, plant decor)
- Feb 23rd: Street light?
- Feb 24th: Figure out how to have char move in environment.
- Feb 25th: Work on game plot. Game objectives.
