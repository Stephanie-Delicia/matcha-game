NEW DEVELOPMENTS:
—————————————————
OVERALL, the project kinda got complicated with the classes I’ve decided to add. Though kinda unnecessary for my scope of game, I REALLY WANTED TO ACCOUNT FOR FUTURE GAMEPLAY ADDONS I MIGHT ADD. But this has made development a bit cumbersome and in dire need of testing. I need a bit more implementation for the Name to Sprite map. BUT, other than that, I just need to test data structures for the next step!

And if all testing gets done with the new data structures, THEN, I can try running everything for gameplay. Then, most likely and very sadly, I’ll have to debug gameplay, but this should be the last hurdle before I feel I have free reigns with adding textures, different gameplay styles, etc.
